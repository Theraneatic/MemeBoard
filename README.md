# MemeBoard
MemeBoard (Program name MemeWare) is a horribly optimized virus, and so inelegant it makes skids everywhere jealous. However, it works. Fight me. Written in C++ using WinAPI.

# Removal Guide
To stop the process, go to Task Manager > Details > MemeWare.exe, right click and end process. 

# Disclaimer
MemeWare (MemeBoard) is not meant to be malicious. Please only use on voluntary subjects or yourself, and do not use without permission from the user you are infecting. 

# State
MemeBoard is out of date and improperly compiled to run. When I find the time to optimize it and write it to be compatable with GCC, it will receive an update.
